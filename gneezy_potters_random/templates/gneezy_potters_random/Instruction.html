    <p>
        In this experiment, you will work with two other group members to make a series of investment decisions.
        In each round of the experiment, your group will receive a budget and has an opportunity to invest.
        Both the rate of return and odd of success will be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each of you will propose an amount to invest, the actual investment amount for your group will be determined based on
        the following rule: one group member's proposal will be randomly chosen and will determine the investment amount
        for the group. You are member {{ within_id }} and the probability that your proposal will be chosen is {{ weight }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings, for the group, from the investment are calculated as follows:
        <u>Investment Return = Return Rate * Investment Amount</u>. The group's total earning from a certain round will be:
        <u>Total Earnings = Budget + Investment Return</u> if the investment is successful and
        <u>Total Earnings = Budget - Investment Amount </u> if the investment fails. Each member in the group will receive
    the same individual payoff which is the group total earning divided by {{ group_size }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly chosen for payment and your total earnings from that
    round will be your final earnings for the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Please note that your identity and decisions for the group will be revealed to your group members at the end of this experiment.</b>
    </p>
