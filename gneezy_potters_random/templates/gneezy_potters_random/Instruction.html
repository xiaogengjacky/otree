    <p>
        In this experiment, you will work with two other group members to make a series of investment decisions.
        In each round of the experiment, each of you will be given a same budget and have an opportunity to invest.
        Both the rate of return and odd of success will be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each of you will decide how much to invest, but the same investment amount will be applied to all three group
        members based on the following rule: one group member's decision will be randomly chosen and applies to all
        group members. You are member {{ within_id }} and the probability that your decision will be chosen is {{ weight }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings, for each member, from the investment are calculated as follows:
        Investment Return = Return Rate * Investment Amount. Your total earning from a certain round will be:
        Total Earnings = Budget + Investment Return if the investment is successful;
        Total Earnings = Budget - Investment Amount if the investment fails.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly chosen for payment and your total earnings from that
    round will be your final earnings for the experiment.
    </p>
