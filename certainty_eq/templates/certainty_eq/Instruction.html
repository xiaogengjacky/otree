    <p>
        In this experiment, you will make a series of decisions. In each round of the experiment, you will receive an amount
        of points as your budget. Your will decide between a lottery and a sure payoff. If you decide to take the lottery,
        it will be played out at the end of the experiment. If you decide to receive a sure payoff, you will receive that sure payoff.
    </p>
    <p>
    <u>Determine the minimum sure payoff you accept</u>: after you see the lottery in each round, you will be asked to specify
        a minimum amount that you would accept in exchange of the lottery. Note that lotteries could pay either positive or
    negative amounts. In the case where a lottery pays a negative amount, you also need to specify a negative amount. That is,
    what is the minimum sure loss that you would accept in exchange of a possible loss provided by the lottery.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Determine between the lottery and the sure payoff</u>: after you decide the minimum amount you would accept
        in exchange of the lottery, the computer will generate a random amount that is larger than the lowest payoff of the lottery
        but smaller than the highest payoff of the lottery. If this random amount is greater than or equal to your specified amount,
        you will receive this random amount as your payoff. If this random amount is smaller than your decided amount,
        you will keep the lottery.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the you end up keeping the lottery, the computer will determine the outcome of the lottery using a random draw.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly picked and your payoff from the picked round will be your final payoff
    from this experiment. Since each round has a equal chance of being picked, it is in your best interest to treat every round
    as if it has been picked.
