    <p>
        In this experiment, you will make a series of investment decisions. In each round of the experiment, you
    will be given a budget and have an opportunity to invest. Both the rate of return and odd of success will be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the investment are calculated as follows: Investment Return = Return Rate * Investment Amount.
    Your total earning from a certain round will be: Total Earnings = Budget + Investment Return if the investment is
        successful; Total Earnings = Budget - Investment Amount if the investment fails.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly chosen for payment and your total earnings from that
    round will be your final earnings for the experiment.
