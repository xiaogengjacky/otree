    <p> Round <b>{{ round_to_pay }}</b> has been chosen for payment. The probability of success was
        <b>{{ chosen_probability }}</b> and the return rate was <b>{{ chosen_return }}</b>. Your group had <b>{{ chosen_endowment }}</b> in the
        round and you proposed to invest <b>{{ investment_p }}</b> as member {{ id_self }}. Member {{ id_other1 }} proposed to invest
        <b>{{ investment_p1 }}</b> and member {{ id_other2 }} proposed to invest <b>{{ investment_p2 }}</b>. The median proposal value
        of <b>{{ group_investment }}</b> was implemented and the investment was <u>{{ outcome }}</u>. Hence, the group payoff is
        <b>{{ group_payoff }}</b> and each member's payoff is <b>{{ payoff }}</b>.
