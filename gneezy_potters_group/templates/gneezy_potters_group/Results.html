<p> Round {{ round_to_pay }} has been chosen for payment. The probability of making a profit from the investment was
    {{ chosen_probability }} and the return rate was {{ chosen_return }}. Your group had {{ chosen_endowment }} in the
    round and you proposed to invest {{ investment_p }} as member {{ id_self }}. Member {{ id_other1 }} proposed to invest
    {{ investment_p1 }} and member {{ id_other2 }} proposed to invest {{ investment_p2 }}. The median proposal value
    of {{ group_investment }} was implemented and the investment was <u>{{ outcome }}</u>. Hence, the group payoff is
    {{ group_payoff }} and each member's payoff is {{ payoff }}.
