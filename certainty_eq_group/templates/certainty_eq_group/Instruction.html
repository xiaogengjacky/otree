    <p>
        In this experiment, you will work with two other group members to make a series of decisions over several rounds.
        In each round of the experiment, each group member will receive an amount of points as his (her) budget;
        the amount of points received is the same across all group members.  All group members will then be shown an identical
        lottery in every round. The lotteries are different across different rounds.
        Each member of your group will then have to go through the followings sequence of decisions in each round.
    </p>
    <p>
    <u>1. Determine the minimum sure payoff to accept</u>: After you and your group mates see the lottery, you and your
        group mates will be asked to each specify a minimum sure amount that your group would accept in exchange of the lottery.
        Note that, the lottery could pay either a positive or a negative amount. In the case where you and your group mates
        see the lottery paying a negative amount, you and your group mates will have to specify the minimum sure loss that your
        group would accept in exchange of a possible loss provided by the lottery. After all group members indicate their amounts,
        the computer will discard the highest amount and the lowest amount among the {{ group_size }} amounts. That is, the computer will
        take the median value among the {{ group_size }} proposed amounts as the group's decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>2. Determining whether your group will receive the lottery or the sure payoff</u>: After your group has
        decided the minimum amount of sure payoff your group would accept in exchange of the lottery, the computer will
        generate a random amount that is larger than the lowest payoff of the lottery but smaller than the highest payoff of the lottery.
        If this random amount is greater than or equal to the group's chosen minimum sure payoff amount (i.e. the median
        value among the {{ group_size }} proposed amounts) that the group is willing to accept in exchange of the lottery,
        the group will receive this random amount as the groupâ€™s payoff in that particular round.
        If this random amount is smaller than the group's chosen minimum sure payoff amount (i.e. the median value among the {{ group_size }}
        proposed amounts) that the group is willing to accept in exchange of the lottery, the group will keep the lottery.
        The computer will then determine the outcome of the lottery using a random draw according to the chance (probability)
        specified in that lottery.


    </p>
    <p>
        IAt the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly picked and your payoff from the picked round will be your final
        payoff from this experiment. Since each round has an equal chance of being picked, it is in your best interest to treat
        every round as if it has been picked.
    </p>
    <p><b>Please note that the amount you propose and your identity will be revealed and
        shared with your group members.</b></p>
